FAQ For MongoDB Generative AI (GenAI) Features
----------------------------------------------

What GenAI Features Does MongoDB Currently Offer?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB offers various GenAI capabilities in its products and services, 
including within Atlas and in its software products. 
For example, in MongoDB Compass and Charts, Atlas users can 
leverage natural language to generate queries or visualizations. 
And with MongoDB Relational Migrator, GenAI can be leveraged for 
Query Conversions.

We also offer a GenAI chatbot within our MongoDB Documentation. 

What Services Do These GenAI Features Rely On?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB's current GenAI features are powered by Azure OpenAI. 
That means that when you use these features,
your data will be processed in Microsoft Azure using the Azure OpenAI 
service. 

Data processed in Azure OpenAI is not used for any model training. 
MongoDB has opted out of asynchronous Abuse Monitoring so that no 
prompts or responses are stored with Azure OpenAI. For more detail, 
please refer to the Azure OpenAI data management policy.

What Data Is Being Sent To The Model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each MongoDB tool backed by GenAI sends the minimal required 
information to produce the best possible answer. To learn more 
about what each tool sends, please consult our Documentation:

- `Compass <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/query-with-natural-language/query-with-natural-language/>`__
- `Atlas Charts <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/charts/experimental-features/>`__
- `Relational Migrator <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/relational-migrator/code-generation/query-converter/>`__

Are Outputs from my Use of MongoDB GenAI Features Used to Train any GenAI Model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No.

Does MongoDB Store my Inputs to the GenAI Feature or the Corresponding Outputs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB stores inputs and outputs from the GenAI service for 
a limited time period (up to one year) for troubleshooting and 
analytics. For any GenAI capabilities offered in our on-premise 
software (Relational Migrator) you may opt out, in which case 
MongoDB does not store inputs or outputs from the model.

What Agreements Govern My Use of MongoDBâ€™s GenAI Features?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your use of GenAI features and software is subject to MongoDB's:

- `Terms of Use <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/terms-of-use>`_
- `Acceptable Use Policy <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy>`_
