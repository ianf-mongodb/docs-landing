FAQ For MongoDB Generative AI Features
--------------------------------------

What GenAI Features Does MongoDB Currently Offer?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB offers various Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities in its products 
and services.
For example, in MongoDB Compass users can 
leverage natural language to generate MongoDB queries.
In Charts, Atlas users have the capability to construct 
GenAI powered visualizations. Additionally, 
MongoDB Relational Migrator utilizes GenAI for query conversions.

We also offer a GenAI chatbot within our MongoDB Documentation. 

What Services Do These GenAI Features Rely On?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB's current GenAI features are powered by Azure OpenAI 
When you use these features, your data is processed in Microsoft 
Azure using the Azure OpenAI service. 

Azure OpenAI does not use any of the data that it processes for any model training. 
MongoDB has opted out of asynchronous Abuse Monitoring
so that no prompts or responses are stored within Azure OpenAI. For more details, 
refer to the Azure OpenAI data management policy.

What Data Is Sent To The Model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each MongoDB tool backed by GenAI sends the minimal required 
information to produce the best possible answer. To learn more 
about what each tool sends, please consult our Documentation:

- `Compass <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/compass-ai-data-usage>`__
- `Atlas Charts <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/charts-ai-data-usage>`__
- `Relational Migrator <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/migrator-ai-data-usage>`__

Are Outputs from my Use of MongoDB GenAI Features Used to Train Models?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No.

Does MongoDB Store my Inputs or their Corresponding Outputs to GenAI Features?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB will store inputs and outputs from the GenAI service for 
up to one year for troubleshooting and 
analytics. For any GenAI capabilities offered in our on-premise 
software (Relational Migrator and Compass), you may opt out of input 
and output storage, in which case MongoDB will not store your inputs or 
outputs.

What Agreements Govern My Use of MongoDB's GenAI Features?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your use of these features is subject to your applicable MongoDB legal 
agreement, our Acceptable Use

Your use of GenAI features and software is subject to MongoDB's 
`Terms of Use <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/terms-of-use>`_.
